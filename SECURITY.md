# Security Policy

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Commitment

We are committed to maintaining a secure and trustworthy codebase for the ai-commit project. This document outlines our security policies, procedures, and best practices for contributors and users.

## üìã Scope

This security policy applies to:
- All source code in the ai-commit repository
- Documentation and configuration files
- Build and deployment processes
- Third-party dependencies

## üîí Security Guidelines

### For Contributors

#### 1. Secure Coding Practices
- **Input Validation**: Always validate user inputs, especially for API keys and file paths
- **Command Injection Prevention**: Never use unsanitized user input in shell commands
- **Error Handling**: Implement proper error handling without exposing sensitive information
- **Dependency Management**: Regularly update dependencies to address security vulnerabilities

#### 2. Git Operations Security
- **Path Sanitization**: Validate all file paths before using them in git commands
- **Command Arguments**: Escape and sanitize all command arguments
- **Working Directory**: Always verify git repository safety before operations

#### 3. API Security
- **Environment Variables**: Store sensitive data (API keys) in environment variables
- **Rate Limiting**: Implement appropriate rate limiting for API calls
- **Error Messages**: Avoid exposing internal error details to users

### For Users

#### 1. API Key Management
- **Environment Variables**: Use `OPENAI_API_KEY` or `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` environment variables
- **Key Rotation**: Regularly rotate your API keys
- **Access Control**: Limit API key access to only necessary services

#### 2. Repository Safety
- **Trusted Repositories**: Only use ai-commit in trusted git repositories
- **Backup Important Data**: Always backup your commit messages before automated operations
- **Review Generated Content**: Always review AI-generated commit messages before committing

## üö® Vulnerability Reporting

### Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability in ai-commit, please follow these steps:

1. **Private Disclosure**: Report vulnerabilities privately to maintain security
   - Email: insuline.ru@gmail.com
   - GitHub Security Advisories: [Report via GitHub](https://github.com/insulineru/ai-commit/security/advisories/new)

2. **Include Details**: Provide the following information:
   - Description of the vulnerability
   - Steps to reproduce
   - Expected vs actual behavior
   - Potential impact
   - Suggested mitigation (if any)

3. **Do Not Disclose Publicly**: Avoid public disclosure until the vulnerability is patched

### Response Timeline

- **Initial Response**: Within 24 hours
- **Security Assessment**: Within 3 business days
- **Patch Development**: Within 7 business days (depending on complexity)
- **Release**: Within 14 business days of confirmation
