# Architecture Decision Records

This document records the major architectural decisions made during the refactoring of the ai-commit project.

## 1. Security Hardening Strategy

### Decision
Implement comprehensive security hardening to prevent command injection vulnerabilities in git operations.

### Context
The original code used `execSync` with unsanitized user input, creating potential command injection vulnerabilities. This was identified as a critical security risk.

### Consequences
- **Positive**: Eliminated all command injection vulnerabilities
- **Positive**: Added input validation for all git operations
- **Positive**: Created reusable security utilities
- **Negative**: Slight performance overhead from input sanitization
- **Negative**: Increased code complexity

### Implementation
- Created `src/security/sanitizer.js` with comprehensive validation functions
- Refactored `src/git/operations.js` to use sanitized inputs
- Added validation for git refs, file paths, and unified diff values

## 2. Error Handling Standardization

### Decision
Implement a standardized error handling system with hierarchical error codes and categories.

### Context
The original code had inconsistent error handling with no standardized error codes or categories, making debugging and error recovery difficult.

### Consequences
- **Positive**: Consistent error handling across all modules
- **Positive**: Better error categorization for appropriate exit codes
- **Positive**: Improved debugging with structured error information
- **Positive**: Easier to add new error types
- **Negative**: Increased boilerplate code for error handling

### Implementation
- Created `src/errors/codes.js` with hierarchical error codes
- Implemented `AiCommitError` class with standardized properties
- Added error codes for different categories: generic, api, git, security, validation, user
- Updated all error handling to use standardized error codes

## 3. Testing Infrastructure

### Decision
Implement comprehensive testing with Jest, including unit tests, integration tests, and coverage reporting.

### Context
The original project had no test infrastructure, making it difficult to ensure code quality and prevent regressions.

### Consequences
- **Positive**: Comprehensive test coverage (targeting 100%)
- **Positive**: CI/CD integration with automated testing
- **Positive**: Better code quality and maintainability
- **Positive**: Easier refactoring with test safety net
- **Negative**: Initial development time investment
- **Negative**: Additional maintenance overhead

### Implementation
- Added Jest configuration with ESM support
- Created comprehensive test suite covering all modules
- Implemented CI/CD pipeline for automated testing
- Added coverage reporting and quality gates

## 4. Code Modernization

### Decision
Upgrade to modern JavaScript features (ES2022) and optimize performance-critical functions.

### Context
The original code used older JavaScript patterns and had performance bottlenecks in text processing functions.

### Consequences
- **Positive**: Improved code readability and maintainability
- **Positive**: Better performance in text processing
- **Positive**: Reduced memory usage
- **Positive**: Modern language features improve developer experience
- **Negative**: Potential compatibility issues with older Node.js versions
- **Negative**: Learning curve for team members

### Implementation
- Converted to ES2022 features (optional chaining, nullish coalescing)
- Optimized `split90` algorithm for better performance
- Refactored prompt generation to use template literals
- Improved code organization and structure

## 5. Dependency Injection

### Decision
Implement a dependency injection container for better testability and modularity.

### Context
The original code had tight coupling between components, making testing and maintenance difficult. Services were created directly within classes.

### Consequences
- **Positive**: Improved testability with mock services
- **Positive**: Reduced coupling between components
- **Positive**: Easier to swap implementations
- **Positive**: Better separation of concerns
- **Negative**: Increased complexity for simple use cases
- **Negative**: Learning curve for dependency injection patterns

### Implementation
- Created `src/di/container.js` with DI container functionality
- Implemented `src/di/services.js` with service registrations
- Updated main application to use dependency injection
- Added test container utilities for mocking

## 6. Documentation Strategy

### Decision
Implement comprehensive documentation with JSDoc, TypeDoc, and architecture records.

### Context
The original project had minimal documentation, making it difficult for new developers to understand the codebase and for users to use the API effectively.

### Consequences
- **Positive**: Comprehensive API documentation
- **Positive**: Better code maintainability with inline documentation
- **Positive**: Easier onboarding for new developers
- **Positive**: Improved developer experience
- **Negative**: Documentation maintenance overhead
- **Negative**: Initial time investment in documentation

### Implementation
- Added JSDoc comments to all public methods and classes
- Created TypeDoc configuration for API documentation generation
- Implemented architecture decision records
- Added comprehensive README with usage examples

## 7. Performance Optimization

### Decision
Optimize performance-critical functions, particularly text processing and prompt generation.

### Context
The original `split90` function had inefficient algorithms for breaking text into lines, and prompt generation used complex nested object structures.

### Consequences
- **Positive**: Improved performance in text processing
- **Positive**: Reduced memory usage
- **Positive**: Better user experience with faster response times
- **Positive**: More efficient prompt generation
- **Negative**: Increased code complexity for optimization
- **Negative**: Potential trade-offs with readability

### Implementation
- Optimized `split90` algorithm with better line breaking logic
- Refactored prompt generation to use template literals
- Reduced memory allocations in text processing
- Improved algorithm efficiency for large inputs

## 8. Security Policy

### Decision
Implement a comprehensive security policy with input validation and secure coding practices.

### Context
The project handles user input and executes system commands, making security a critical concern. The original code had minimal security validation.

### Consequences
- **Positive**: Eliminated command injection vulnerabilities
- **Positive**: Comprehensive input validation
- **Positive**: Secure coding practices enforced
- **Positive**: Reduced security risks
- **Negative**: Performance overhead from validation
- **Negative**: Increased development complexity

### Implementation
- Created comprehensive input validation functions
- Implemented shell argument sanitization
- Added file path validation for git operations
- Created security utilities for safe command execution

## 9. CI/CD Pipeline

### Decision
Implement automated CI/CD pipeline with testing, linting, and deployment automation.

The original project had no automated testing or deployment process, making releases error-prone and time-consuming.

### Consequences
- **Positive**: Automated testing ensures code quality
- **Positive**: Consistent deployment process
- **Positive**: Reduced human error in releases
